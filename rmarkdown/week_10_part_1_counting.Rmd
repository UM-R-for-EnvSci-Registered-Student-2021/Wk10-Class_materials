One important part of data exploration is **counting things**, whether this is as a summary variable, or as a check to better understand your data or ensure that the data is the way that you thought it was.

For this class we are going to use a slightly modified version of a [dataset](https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/Environment-and-Food/OD0001-Pesticide-Analysis-for-Stream-Water/jj4n-qqq2) of pesticide sample analyses results for stream water samples for the province of PEI's Pesticide Monitoring Program. The sampling includes a total of 9 rivers across PEI, with at least 3 of the rivers being sampled each year.


```{r data loading and clean-up}

pest_original <- read_csv(here("data", "pesticides.csv"))

pest_data <- pest_original %>% 
  clean_names()

print(pest_data)

```

# Let's answer some questions about the data

## What rivers where sampled

If i wanted to get a list of all the rivers that were sampled each year, I can use `distinct()` which will just give me a list of unique character strings per year

```{r}

pest_data %>% 
  distinct(river)

```
But, how many sites is this? I can just apply `tally()` to this list and it will return the number of elements.

```{r}

pest_data %>% 
  distinct(river) %>% 
  tally()

```

## How many rivers were sampled per year

We can list several variables inside `distinct()`. This allows us to request the distinct combinations of those variables, in this case, unique combinations of year and river

```{r}

 pest_data %>%
  distinct(year, river) 

```


And now we can **tally** them to see how many combinations or river **AND** year were sampled.

```{r}

 pest_data %>%
  distinct(year, river) %>% 
  tally()

```

But what if i am interested on **How many rivers were sampled each year?**

We need an extra step!

We can use `group_by()` (which we have used before in the course) to tell R to narrow my tally.

```{r}

 pest_data %>%
  distinct(year, river) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  tally()

```

Now we are talking! But, there is even an easier option. The function `count()` is a **combination** of `group_by()` and `tally()` all in one step!

```{r}

 pest_data %>%
  distinct(year, river) %>% 
  count(year) # here year means "by year"

```

**NOTE**: It is a bit counter-intuitive, but what goes inside of the `count()` is not the thing you want to count (i don't want to count years, i want to count rivers!) but what **groupings** you want to do for your counting

## What compounds were analysed?

We can do exactly the same for the compounds

```{r}

pest_data %>% 
  distinct(compound)

```

How many compounds is that?

```{r}

pest_data %>% 
  distinct(compound) %>% 
  tally()

```

## How many compound of each pesticide group were analysed?

The different pesticides measured belong to different pesticide groups. In order to count how many pesticides of each group were measured, first we make a list of distinct pesticide/group combinations in the dataset with `distinct()` and then we count how many on each group using `count()`  

```{r}

pest_data %>% 
  distinct(compound, group)

```

```{r}

pest_groups <- pest_data %>% 
  distinct(compound, group) %>% 
  count(group)

print(pest_groups)

```

```{r}

pest_groups %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = n, y = group), fill = "#ffb703") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = 0, add = 0)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 70)) +
  # theme_pepe_full() + (not needed anymore! We have set the theme for the whole file earlier!)
  labs(y = NULL,
       x = "Number of compounds",
       title = "Compounds analyzed in this program")

```
What if i wanted to know this distribution **per year**?

This one is a bit trickier, but it is just a matter of doing things step by step (thank you pipes!). 

We want to know things also **by year** so now we can just add `year` to our `distinct()`

```{r}

pest_group_year <- pest_data %>% 
  distinct(year, compound, group) %>%  # distinct combinations of year, compound and group
  count(year, group) # Jut like in group_by() we can ask it to count the combinations of more than one variable

print(pest_group_year)

```
This allows us to create some nice summary figures

```{r}

pest_group_year %>% 
  mutate(year = factor(year)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = n, y = group, fill = year), position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "magma", end = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = 0, add = 0)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 70)) +
  # theme_pepe_full() + (not needed anymore! We have set the theme for the whole file earlier!)
  labs(y = NULL,
       x = "Number of compounds",
       title = "Compounds analyzed in this program by year")

```

# How many samples were collected

One common thing to report is the number of samples that were collected (or considered in an analysis). Calculating the number of samples in this dataset (and many other like it, remember this was taken from a government database) is a bit tricky, because the data is already in **long form**, as such, the *"one sample per row"* does not apply anymore. Now each row is a specific measure of one compound, but a whole pannel of compounds were measured for each sample (i.e. each bottle taken of the river).

However we can still count the number of samples if we get a bit creative.

In this case, a particular sample is each **individual combination of river and date**. I went to a specific river, on a specific date and grabbed a bottle of water, that is a sample. So if i count the number of unique combinations of **date AND river**, then i can count the samples


```{r}

pest_data %>% 
  distinct(date_sampled, river) %>% 
  tally()

```

Could we calculate the number of samples collected each year? We sure can!

```{r}

pest_data %>% 
  distinct(year, date_sampled, river) %>% 
  count(year) # count "by_year"

```


# Creating nice summary tables

Let's what compounds were measured each year:

```{r}

pest_data %>% 
  distinct(year, compound)

```

This is a great format for us to keep on working with the data, but what if i wanted to make it more visually appealing for a paper?

Here is one approach.

Let's start by adding a dummy column of ones, by asking `count()` to count for all the groups:

```{r}

pest_data %>% 
  distinct(year, compound) %>% 
  count(year, compound)

```

Because we are telling it to count by the same variables that we are grouping, obviously the value on **n** is always one

But why did we do this?

Now we can use `pivot_wider()`, telling it to fill the empty combinations (i.e. those that don exist in this dataset) with zeros and we have a nice presence/absence table that we can use for a publication (maybe in the SI)

```{r}

compoun_year_table <- pest_data %>% 
  distinct(year, compound) %>% 
  count(year, compound) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = n, values_fill = 0)

print(compoun_year_table)

```

# Quick note on some nice tools to make nice-looking tables

By now we have seen how we can save our data frames (or tibbles) into a csv that we can then add to our publications. When we have a chunk of code that generates one of these, RStudio shows us a nice interactive table, but when we knit to `.md` or `html` R only gives us the same output we would get in the console, not very nice, and not even all the data.

There are a number of packages available that help you formating a data frame or tibble into a nice display table. One of them is `{gt}`. 

`{gt}` works a bit like `{ggplot}` but instead of layers of visual data, you can add speciffic instructions for formating a table. You can read more on their [page](https://gt.rstudio.com/index.html).

```{r}

compoun_year_table %>% 
  gt() %>%      # note that on gt() you add "layers" with a pipe, not a "+" like in ggplot!
   tab_header(
    title = md("**Sampled compounds**"),
    subtitle = str_c("Distribution of sampled compounds between", min(pest_data$year), "&", max(pest_data$year), sep = " ")
  )

```

What if we want to separate the different pesticide clases in the table?.

Sometimes we want to keep information about an additional column to go through the summary process, even if we could acchieve the summary without it. Sometimes we can. In this case, we are going to include `group` in all the `distinct()` and `count()` steps and see what hapens.

```{r}

compound_year_with_groups <- pest_data %>% 
  distinct(year, compound, group) %>% 
  count(year, compound, group) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = n, values_fill = 0)

print(compound_year_with_groups)

```

Same numbe rof rows, so nothing changed. However, now we have this aditional layer of info we can use in a summary table!

```{r}

compound_year_with_groups %>% 
  gt(groupname_col = "group") %>%  # we tell it which of our columns we want to use as groups
   tab_header(
    title = md("**Sampled compounds**"),
    subtitle = str_c("Distribution of sampled compounds between", min(pest_data$year), "&", max(pest_data$year), sep = " ")
  )

```
